      "What an incredible day! Our 50-day celebration marked the first major milestone of our CSE journey. The auditorium was packed with excited students, proud faculty, and enough pizza to feed a small army. We had ice-breaker games that actually broke the ice (and some friendships ðŸ˜„), group photos where everyone tried to look serious but failed miserably, and speeches that ranged from inspiring to hilariously awkward. The highlight was definitely when Professor Ahmed tried to explain recursion using pizza slices - we're still confused but we got free pizza! This day officially marked us as 'real' CSE students, whatever that means.",
